THIS PROJECT IS NOT FULLY COMPLETE!

Due to some...issues with ASP.NET, this project just shows the data you input for a single Pokemon instead of 2 Pokemon simulating a battle.

When you start the application, type the name of the Pokemon into the 'Name' textbox, the Pokemon's level into the 'Level' textbox, and select the Pokemon's nature from the dropdown menu labeled 'Nature'.

You also enter in the Pokedex ID of the chosen Pokemon to make the image of the Pokemon appear (My hope is to make it so you don't have to enter the ID)

I'll continue to work on this project in the future, so hopefully I can get a fully working simulator eventually.
