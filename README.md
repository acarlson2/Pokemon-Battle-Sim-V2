THIS PROJECT IS NOT FULLY COMPLETE!

Due to some...issues with ASP.NET, this project just shows the data you input for a single Pokemon instead of 2 Pokemon simulating a battle.

When you start the application, type the name of the Pokemon into the 'Name' textbox, the Pokemon's level into the 'Level' textbox, and select the Pokemon's nature from the dropdown menu labeled 'Nature'.

I also tried to get an image of the Pokemon to show up on the result screen, but it's not working for some reason.

I'll continue to work on this project in the future, so hopefully I can get a fully working simulator eventually.
